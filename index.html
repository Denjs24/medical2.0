But despite all the difficulties that have arisen over the past year, life is going on, including all professional activities. They had changed, taken on new forms, and become a new reality. 									</strong>								</p>								<p>									However, this reality has expanded and simplified communication between people and countries, at least virtually. It allows gaining new knowledge, new friends, and teachers literally without leaving home... Taking advantage of new opportunities, we are pleased to invite you to the 3rd Congress of CEEBCSC, organized in Ukraine, based on the Center of Mammology of the LISOD Hospital of Israeli Oncology, which is one of the co-founders of CEEBCSC and is one of the BRESO training centers. 								</p>								<p>									The main goal of the Congress is to create a platform for open and interesting professional communication for breast surgeons in the region, a platform where you can demonstrate your experience and achievements and learn from colleagues. We want Congress to interest and unite as many active professionals as possible and encourage surgeons to implement the best strategies and methods of breast cancer treatment in their daily practice, regardless of the different economic levels of our countries in the region. We want to share our passion for achieving the best results by encouraging everyone who cares.								</p>								<p><strong>Join us and invite your colleagues! <br> Hope to see you on 15-16 of October 2021.</strong></p>							</div>						</div>						<div class="welcome__piples piple-welcome">							<div class="piple-welcome__item">								<div class="piple-welcome__head">									<picture><source srcset="img/welcome/01.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/welcome/01.jpg" alt="Piple-01"></picture>								</div>								<div class="piple-welcome__body">									<p class="piple-welcome__name">										Andrii Zhygulin MD									</p>									<p class="piple-welcome__direction">										Head of Breast Unit LISOD Hospital of Israeli Oncology, Kyiv, Ukraine									</p>								</div>							</div>							<div class="piple-welcome__item">								<div class="piple-welcome__head">									<picture><source srcset="img/welcome/02.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/welcome/02.jpg" alt="Piple-02"></picture>								</div>								<div class="piple-welcome__body">									<p class="piple-welcome__name">										Золтан Матраї									</p>									<p class="piple-welcome__direction">										Президент CEECBCS									</p>								</div>							</div>						</div>					</div>				</section>				<section class="page__scientific scientific">					<div class="scientific__container _container">						<div class="scientific__title _title">							<p class="_title-title">Scientific Board</p>							<p class="_title-subtitle">We want Congress to interest and unite as many active professionals as possible and encourage surgeons to implement the best strategies and methods of breast cancer treatment in their daily practice, regardless of the different economic levels of our countries in the region. </p>						</div>						<div class="scientific__slider _swiper">							<div class="scientific__item item-piple">								<div class="item-piple__image">									<picture><source srcset="img/scientific/01.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="img/scientific/01.png" alt="Piple-01"></picture>								</div>								<div class="item-piple__description">									<p class="item-piple__name">КРИСТОФ АНДРЕЕ MD, ПРОФЕССОР									</p>									<p class="item-piple__subtext">										Профессор клиники Sana Kliniken, Дюссельдорф.
